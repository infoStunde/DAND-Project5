# ((TITLE)) Data Exploration

## Dataset

The data consists of ((ENTRIES)), including
17. The dataset can be found in [here](address),
with feature documentation available [here](address).


## Summary of Findings

In the exploration, I found that there was a ((strong relationship between )). The relationship is
approximately linear between ((features)) when ((feature)) is transformed to be on
a logarithmic scale and transformed to be on a scale)). I found a
somewhat surprising result initially when the marginal trend for the ((features)) variables indicated that higher quality was associated with
lower ((feature)). However, higher  quality was also associated with smaller
((ITEM)). When I isolated ((ITEMS)) of a single ((feature)), there was a clear
positive relationship between higher  quality and higher ((feature)).

Outside of the main variables of interest, I verified the relationship between
 ((feature)) dimensions. For the dataset given,
there was an interesting interaction in the categorical  quality
features. The lower ((feature)) grades looked like they had slightly better
distribution of ((feature)) than ((items)) with the higher ((feature)).


## Key Insights for Presentation

For the presentation, I focus on just the influence of ((feature))
and leave out most of the intermediate derivations. I start by introducing the
((feature)) variable, followed by the pattern in ((feature)) distribution, then plot the
transformed scatterplot.

Afterwards, I introduce each of the categorical variables one by one. To start,
I use the violin plots of ((feature)) and ((feature)) across ((feature)). I'm only looking at
the ((feature)) grade plot here since it's the clearest example of how the
categorical quality grades affect ((feature)). The other two categorical
variables, ((features)), are covered afterwards, using point plots. I've made
sure to use different color palettes for each quality variable to make sure it
is clear that they're different between plots.
